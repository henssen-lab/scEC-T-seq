## Microhomology analysis

Analysis of the microhomology present in the extrachromosomal circular DNA junctions for CHP212 and TR14 cell lines

Based on BLAST

#### Run microhomology analysis for both cell lines

```bash
Rscript script_microhomology_analysis_BLAST_v2.R
```

#### Plot the distribution of microhomology length for both cell lines (Violin plot)

```bash
Rscript script_plot_microHOMlength_circles.R
```
